# Project Wublue
Wublue is a fork of Niklas's Aurora project which itself is a fork of Bluefin, which has the aim of creating a comfortable desktop based on the Universal Blue platform. Wublue aims to recreate the look and feel of MicrosoftÂ® Windows 11, while still being authentically Linux. Wublue comes with the KDE Plasma desktop with a collection of different themes and tweaks to achieve this. Wublue also comes with a fleet of software (As well as a handful of web apps) which aim to recreate the Windows experience.
